# Cash Calculator

## Description
The Cash Calculator is a simple yet powerful web-based application designed to facilitate the quick and accurate calculation of cash amounts based on various denominations provided by the user. This tool is particularly useful for scenarios where precise cash management is required, such as in banking, retail, or budgeting. The calculator takes input for different denominations—2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1—and computes the total cash value in real-time.

In addition to numeric results, the tool also translates the total cash value into readable text, providing users with an intuitive way to verify and confirm amounts. Whether you're handling large sums of cash or simply need to verify the total, this calculator ensures accuracy and convenience. The application also features a reset button that clears all input fields and results, allowing for easy reuse.
